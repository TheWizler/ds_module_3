module_3 Python Scripting

In this module we opened and iterated through data provided through a .csv file, extracted specific metrics e.g. "Profit/Losses", change in "Profit/Losses", greatest increase and decrease in profits, and the winner and output of an election.

We used functions, variables, for loops and to accomplish this; using f-strings to output the data in a structured, easy to read way.
